Submitted by: **Haseeb Khan**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used w3 schools when looking up how to make a block expand when using the hover function, and the implementation of flex]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge I encountered was going through the application of the guess function, since I rarely use Javascript when I was appplying the logic in Javascript
I feel that I was making it way more difficult then it needed to be, I feel that this was more of a mental block. The way I over came this was by
thinking about how I would approach this in a language I'm more comfortable in like java, after that I thought about it I realized that the problem
was acutally much more simple than I was making it out to be and that there isn't really much of a difference between how java and Javascript would implement this]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[The questions that I have about web development is what is the thought process they have when they approach a problem, another question that
I had is when coding an application, how do they go about seeing what things that can be improved upon.
Another question that I had is for those that work in full-stack development is their time spent more on the back-end or the front end, or does it just depend on the type of application]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project a few thing I would want to do is to have the blocks switch places durring each round.
Another feature that I would have liked to work on were to be different game modes, so for example making a sound memory test and visual memory test
In this two versions the sound part would hide the blocks' and only play sound and the user would only be allowed to have the different sounds allowed to be chosen]
